cd /etc/apt  #location where source file storing package info like package names and locations are stored

sudo apt-get upgrade  #To get latest softwware versions
sudo apt-get install <Package_Name> #This command is used to install or upgrade packages. It is followed by one or more package names the user wishes to install.
apt-get remove <Package_Name> #it removes the packages instead of installing. It does not remove any configuration files created by the package.
apt-get purge <Package_Name> #This command removes the packages, and also removes any configuration files related to the packages.
apt-get autoremove #Sometimes the packages which are automatically installed to satisfy the dependencies of other packages, are no longer needed then autoremove command is used to remove these kind of packages.

apt-cache pkgnames #To list all available packages
apt-cache pkgnames <Package_Name> #To list specific package
apt-cache search <keyword> #To list of all packages where keyword is part of a package name or any words used in its description

#Logging & Log Management:-

vi /etc/rsyslog.conf

#All system and kernel messages get passed to rsyslogd.For every log message received Rsyslog looks at its configuration file, /etc/rsyslog.conf to determine how to handle that message. 
Rsyslog looks through the configuration file for all rule statements which match that message and handles the message as each rule statement dictates. 
If no rule statement matches the message, Rsyslog discards it. Rule statements specify two things:
1. what messages to match (selectors), and
2. what to do with matched messages (actions).


#Service Management:-
ls /etc/init.d  #Listing service script files under initi.d directory

#init.d is the sub-directory of /etc directory in Linux file system. 
#init.d basically contains the bunch of start/stop scripts which are used to control (start,stop,reload,restart) the daemon while the system is running or during boot. 
There are two types of scripts :  K scripts & S scripts.
K scripts are known 'kill' scripts while S scripts are known as 'startup' scripts. Kill scripts always run before startup scripts. 
The configuration file (.conf) of these scripts are located under /etc/init & the scripts that are used as defaults are located under /etc/default.
Within /etc/init.d you'll find the script rc.local ,this script is automatically executed after all primarily priortized scripts are executed. 
Which means first K scripts are executed, following by S scripts, then all other remaining init level scripts (if there's any) & finally rc.local script.

#sudo /etc/init.d/<script> <option>
sudo /etc/init.d/pulseaudio restart

sudo /etc/init.d/speech-dispatcher status   #To know the status of the service
sudo service smbd start
sudo service smbd stop
sudo service --status-all  # From result displayed the prefix "+" means servcie running; "-" means service not running; "?" means service is disabled or in any other status which is not important


#Process Managment:-
#Any pgm running a process and has process entry in the process table within OS
ps #If you run ps command without any arguments, it displays processes for the current shell.
ps a or ps e #Display every active process on a Linux system in generic format.
ps ef #Display full format listing
ps aux #
a = show processes for all users
u = display the process's user/owner
x = also show processes not attached to a terminal

ps aux | grep firefox  #List all processes having firefox as keyword

top  # list of processes rightnow running and updating periodically with other statistcis like pid, cpu, priority, memory etc

#Process Management kill & killall:-
#killall is a tool for terminating running processes on your system based on name. In contrast, kill terminates processes based on Process ID number (PID).
#https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/use-killall-and-kill-to-stop-processes-on-linux/
#https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-kill-a-process-in-linux/

man kill #manual page of kill command
pidof firefox  # To know the process ids of firefox process
kill <process_id> #To kill the process using its process id
killall firefox # To kill the firefox process
killall -9 firefox #To kill firefox process by sending signal 9 which means kill
man 7 signal #will show you a complete table with a brief summary of the meaning of each signal

#Building Software:-
#https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-magic-behind-configure-make-make-install
#It makes sure all of the dependencies for the rest of the build and install process are available, and finds out whatever it needs to know to use those dependencies.
./configure

#we can invoke make to build the software. This runs a series of tasks defined in a Makefile to build the finished program from its source code.
make

#Once the software is built and ready to run, the files can be copied to their final destinations. The make install command will copy the built program, and its libraries and documentation, to the correct locations.
make install

#Useful utilities: grep,sed
grep file*    #Searching files not anything inside directories
grep -r file* #Seraching file keyword all over including inside directories

apt-catch search apache | grep -i php #Search all packages having apache keyword and filter only having php keyword; i is to ignore case in php keyword

#sed
# Replacing true with false ; only first occurance; s stands for string; | means passing the output to next command
echo this is true | sed 's/true/false/'
echo this is true true true | sed 's/true/false/g' #replacing not only first occuarnce but all; g stands for global changes

#Kernel modules
#A kernel module is a program which can loaded into or unloaded from the kernel upon demand, without necessarily recompiling it (the kernel) or rebooting the system, and is intended to enhance the functionality of the kernel. They are similar like plugins to software. In Linux, all modules end with the .ko extension.
#https://www.tecmint.com/load-and-unload-kernel-modules-in-linux/

lsmod  #To list all currently loaded modules in Linux, we can use the lsmod (list modules) command 
cd /lib/modules   #location of all modules; sometimes modules are under /proc/module;

sudo insmod <module name with complete path>  #Installing module
sudo rmmod <module name with complete path>   #Uninstalling module

#Kernel Config
cat /etc/sysctl.conf  #To view system control configutation file on console
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians  #To view this flag from sysctl file
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1 #To change this flag to 1 but it will not persist across reboots
sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf #To edit the above flag in the file; uncomment the flag and save the file
sudo sysctl -p #To make this change persistant across the reboots

#User Management - Files
cat /etc/passwd  #To view password files on console
#username:password:userid:groupid:name of the users:home directory:default shell user will use

sudo cat etc/shadow  #To view just username and password
cat /etc/group   #To list of usergroups

#User Management - Adding & Changing Users
sudo useradd -d /home/icpl14134 -s /bin/bash -g staff -m ric #Creating and adding a new user ric with given parameters
cat /etc/passwd  #Verify added user ric in the pasword file
sudo usermod -g gdm #Changing group from staff to gdm
cat /etc/passwd #Verifying the group id has been chaged and now it is of group gdm
sudo userdel ric  #Deletign user ric
cat /etc/passwd  #Verifying user ric does not exist at all

sudo passwd ric #To set up password for user ric
