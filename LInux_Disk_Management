##Physical Volume (PV): it is a whole disk or a partition of a disk#
#Volume Group (VG): corresponds to one or more PV
#Logical Volume (LV): represents a portion of a VG. A LV can only belong to one VG. Itâ€™s on a LV that we can create a file system.

#Create Physical Volume

#Create Logical Volume

#Display the volumes
